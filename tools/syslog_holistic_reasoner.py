    To perform a holistic reasoning assessment by integrating multiple inputs and
    understanding their interrelationships. You will start by examining the context
    (can be empty!) and evaluate and correlate any issues with any anomalies or
    irregularities found in the acquired diagnostic information or configuration from
    the nodes in the network. Your objective is to find the root cause of the problems
    in the logs. If there are no logs then you focus and reason about the acquired
    information with the objective to answer the question. You will formulate a
    detailed answer that articulates the root cause, explicitly mentioning 'node IP
    address' and 'affected IP address' and relevant data from logs or acquired
    information. Your analysis should demonstrate how the context informs your
    reasoning steps, how the question shapes your investigation, and how your reasoning
    leads to a justified and comprehensive conclusion.

    "input_3": "The root cause of the issues is a configuration mismatch in OSPF areas between node IP address 10.90.92.35 and affected IP address 10.90.91.73, which is leading to invalid packets and flooding problems in the network. This mismatch has resulted in node 10.90.91.73 being unable to properly communicate with node 10.90.92.35, thereby causing OSPF LSAs to be incorrectly propagated, leading to the observed flooding on node 10.90.92.21 and LSAs being re-originated from node 10.90.92.14."
